about:
  team:
    james:
      If it's beautiful, functional, and innovative - it was probably James' idea. 
      With a background in genetics, he quickly pivoted into the tech industry and hasn't looked back since. 
      His broad experience ranges from fintech startups in NYC to embedded systems and iOS development for fitness companies, so he's sure to fit well into any situation.
      <br/>If you can't find James in the office, he's probably out on his mountain bike with the kids or snapping pics of the southern night sky.
    tom:
      Our 3D wizard and infrastructure guru. With a knack for picking up new technologies in a flash, he truely shines in any environment.
      Tom's experience ranges from behind-the-scenes development for prestigious television broadcasts to native 3D applications for adjudicating sailing events.
      <br/>When he's not creating exceptional software you can find him out in the surf, hiking South Island mountains, or pottering in the garden with his partner.
